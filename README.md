## About
This is a simple App for calculating BMI based on the Hong Kong standard. To learn more, browse the Centre for Health Protection.

BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a widely used measure to assess whether an individual has a healthy body weight for a given height. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters. Although BMI doesn’t measure body fat directly, it is a useful screening tool to identify possible weight problems in adults.

The app categorizes BMI into different levels, each indicating a specific health status:

'Underweight': A BMI less than 18.5 is considered underweight. This may indicate malnutrition, an eating disorder, or other health issues that could lead to weakened immune function, osteoporosis, and fertility problems.

'Normal weight': A BMI within 18.5 and 22.9 is considered normal. This range indicates that you are likely to have a balanced weight that is associated with the lowest risk of serious health conditions.

'Overweight-edge': A BMI between 23 and 24.9 is considered overweight. Individuals in this range might be at an increased risk of developing heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.

'Obesity-moderate': A BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered moderate obesity. Being in this range indicates a higher risk for various health problems, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer.

'Obesity-severe': A BMI more than 30 is considered severe obesity. This significantly increases the risk of severe health issues, including metabolic syndrome, musculoskeletal disorders, and overall mortality.

Usage of BMI in Controlling Health Issues
BMI is an important tool for public health and individual health management. Here’s how it helps in controlling health issues:

Screening Tool: BMI is used by healthcare professionals to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems. It helps in identifying individuals who might benefit from further evaluation and possible interventions.

Risk Assessment: By categorizing BMI, healthcare providers can estimate the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. This risk assessment is crucial for early intervention.

Guidance for Weight Management: BMI provides a benchmark for setting realistic weight loss or gain goals. It helps individuals understand where they stand and what steps they need to take to achieve a healthier weight.

Monitoring: Regularly monitoring BMI allows individuals and healthcare providers to track changes over time, providing a clear picture of how lifestyle changes or treatments are impacting body weight.

Policy Making and Health Programs: Public health authorities use BMI data to design and implement health policies and programs aimed at improving population health, such as nutritional guidelines, physical activity recommendations, and obesity prevention strategies.

While BMI is a useful tool, it’s important to note that it doesn’t consider other factors such as muscle mass, bone density, and overall body composition. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other assessments and not as a sole diagnostic tool.
